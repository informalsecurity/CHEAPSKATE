# CHEAPSKATE
## Comprehensive Hierarchical Exfiltration Analysis & Pre-Sorting Kit for Affordable Triage Examination

üïµÔ∏è **Save $100K-millions on forensic analysis fees by pre-sorting your data breach evidence**

CHEAPSKATE is a PowerShell-based tool that creates interactive HTML directory trees from MFT (Master File Table) files, allowing security teams to quickly identify and categorize exfiltrated data before sending it to expensive forensic vendors.

---

## üéØ **Use Case: Data Breach Response**

**The Problem:**
- Data exfiltration incident occurs
- Forensic vendors charge $500-2000/hour to analyze directory structures
- You need to report which records were stolen (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Sending entire drives = massive forensic bills

**The Solution:**
- Extract MFT from compromised systems
- Use CHEAPSKATE to create interactive directory tree
- Security team pre-sorts directories into "has sensitive data" vs "irrelevant"
- Send only marked directories to forensic vendor
- **Result: 70-90% reduction in forensic analysis costs**

## ‚ú® **Key Features**

### üå≥ **Interactive Directory Tree**
- Collapsible directory structure with size information
- Click arrows to expand/collapse branches
- Real-time search across all directories
- Professional dark theme optimized for long analysis sessions

### üìä **Smart Data Tracking**
- **"Has Data" checkboxes** - mark directories containing sensitive information
- **Running totals** - see cumulative size/file count of selected directories
- **Smart parent/child logic** - prevents double-counting when both parent and child are selected
- **Persistent notes** - add investigation notes to directories

### üìà **Professional Reporting**
- **CSV export** of selected directories with size data
- **JSON export/import** of all analysis data for team collaboration
- **Forensic documentation** ready for legal proceedings
- **Unique per-MFT storage** - no cross-contamination between cases

### ‚ö° **Enterprise Performance**
- **Memory optimized** - handles multi-million record MFTs with <2GB RAM
- **Streaming processing** - no more 30GB+ memory usage
- **Batch processing** with progress reporting
- **O(n) algorithms** - linear scaling for massive datasets

---

## üöÄ **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
- Windows PowerShell 5.1+
- MFT file extracted from compromised system (using tools like FTK Imager, etc.)

### Installation
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CHEAPSKATE.git
cd CHEAPSKATE

# Run the tool
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath "C:\Evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile "C:\Analysis\breach_analysis.html"
```

### Basic Usage
```powershell
# Analyze MFT with default settings
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile ".\analysis.html"

# Custom depth limit for faster processing
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile ".\analysis.html" -MaxDepth 8

# Smaller batch size for very large MFTs
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile ".\analysis.html" -BatchSize 5000
```

---

## üìã **Workflow Example**

### Step 1: Generate Analysis
```powershell
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath "C:\Evidence\Suspect_MFT" -OutputHtmlFile "C:\Analysis\breach_triage.html"
```

### Step 2: Security Team Analysis
1. Open `breach_triage.html` in browser
2. Search for sensitive directory names (`Documents`, `Database`, `Confidential`, etc.)
3. Check "has data" boxes for directories containing sensitive information
4. Add investigation notes to key directories
5. Monitor running totals at top of page

### Step 3: Generate Reports
1. **CSV Export**: Click "üìä Export to CSV" for spreadsheet analysis
2. **Team Collaboration**: Export analysis data as JSON to share with team
3. **Forensic Vendor**: Send only marked directories for detailed analysis

### Step 4: Cost Savings
- **Before**: Send entire Drive ‚Üí $50K-200K forensic bill
- **After**: Send pre-sorted evidence ‚Üí $5K-20K forensic bill (no need to pay them to scan your ISO's and CAB files)
- **Savings**: 70-90% reduction in vendor costs
