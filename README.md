# CHEAPSKATE
## Comprehensive Hierarchical Exfiltration Analysis & Pre-Sorting Kit for Affordable Triage Examination

üïµÔ∏è **Save $100K-millions on forensic analysis fees by pre-sorting your data breach evidence**

CHEAPSKATE is a PowerShell-based tool that creates interactive HTML directory trees from MFT (Master File Table) files, allowing security teams to quickly identify and categorize exfiltrated data before sending it to expensive forensic vendors.

---

## üéØ **Use Case: Data Breach Response**

**The Problem:**
- Data exfiltration incident occurs
- Forensic vendors charge $500-2000/hour to analyze directory structures
- You need to report which records were stolen (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Sending entire drives = massive forensic bills

**The Solution:**
- Extract MFT from compromised systems
- Use CHEAPSKATE to create interactive directory tree
- Security team pre-sorts directories into "has sensitive data" vs "irrelevant"
- Send only marked directories to forensic vendor
- **Result: 70-90% reduction in forensic analysis costs**

### Installation
```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CHEAPSKATE.git
cd CHEAPSKATE

# Run the tool
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath "C:\Evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile "C:\Analysis\breach_analysis.html"

.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile ".\analysis.html"

# Custom depth limit for faster processing
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile ".\analysis.html" -MaxDepth 8

# Smaller batch size for very large MFTs
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -OutputHtmlFile ".\analysis.html" -BatchSize 5000
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **File Extractor Usage Examples**

```batch
robocopy "E:\Users\Documents" "C:\ExtractForVendor\Users\Documents" "*.docx" "*.xlsx" "*.pdf" /S /E /COPYALL /R:3 /W:1 /MT:8
```

### **PowerShell Script (Detailed Progress)**
```powershell
.\CHEAPSKATE-FileExtractor.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -CheapskateCSV ".\selected_dirs.csv" -SourceDrive "E:" -OutputDirectory "C:\ExtractForVendor" -OutputFormat PowerShell
```

**Generates:** PowerShell script with progress tracking and error handling
```powershell
Write-Host "‚úì Users\Documents\Financial_Records\2024_Budget.xlsx" -ForegroundColor Gray
Write-Host "‚úì Users\Documents\Contracts\NDA_Template.docx" -ForegroundColor Gray
```

### **File List (Third-Party Tools)**
```powershell
.\CHEAPSKATE-FileExtractor.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -CheapskateCSV ".\selected_dirs.csv" -SourceDrive "E:" -OutputFormat FileList
```

**Generates:** Simple text file with full paths for use with other tools
```
E:\Users\Documents\Financial_Records\2024_Budget.xlsx
E:\Users\Documents\Contracts\NDA_Template.docx
E:\Users\Downloads\Confidential\Internal_Memo.pdf
```

### **JSON Manifest (Automation)**
```powershell
.\CHEAPSKATE-FileExtractor.ps1 -MFTPath ".\evidence\$MFT" -CheapskateCSV ".\selected_dirs.csv" -SourceDrive "E:" -OutputDirectory "C:\ExtractForVendor" -OutputFormat JSON
```

**Generates:** Structured data for API integration and automation
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "generated": "2025-09-16T14:30:25Z",
    "source_drive": "E:",
    "total_files": 1247,
    "tool": "CHEAPSKATE File Extractor"
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "source_path": "E:\\Users\\Documents\\Budget.xlsx",
      "dest_path": "C:\\ExtractForVendor\\Users\\Documents\\Budget.xlsx",
      "file_size": 2048576
    }
  ]
}

## üìã **Workflow Example**

### Step 1: Generate Analysis
```powershell
.\Generate-MemoryOptimizedTree.ps1 -MFTPath "C:\Evidence\Suspect_MFT" -OutputHtmlFile "C:\Analysis\breach_triage.html"
```

### Step 2: Security Team Analysis
1. Open `breach_triage.html` in browser
2. Search for sensitive directory names (`Documents`, `Database`, `Confidential`, etc.)
3. Check "has data" boxes for directories containing sensitive information
4. Add investigation notes to key directories
5. Monitor running totals at top of page

### Step 3: Generate Reports
1. **CSV Export**: Click "üìä Export to CSV" for spreadsheet analysis
2. **Team Collaboration**: Export analysis data as JSON to share with team
3. **Forensic Vendor**: Send only marked directories for detailed analysis

### **Step 4: File Extraction Planning**
```powershell
# Generate extraction scripts from your selections
.\CHEAPSKATE-FileExtractor.ps1 -MFTPath "evidence\$MFT" -CheapskateCSV "selected_directories.csv" -SourceDrive "D:" -OutputDirectory "C:\ForensicExtract" -OutputFormat RoboCopy
```

**Parameters:**
- **`-MFTPath`** - Original MFT file (for detailed file analysis)
- **`-CheapskateCSV`** - CSV exported from Step 1
- **`-SourceDrive`** - Drive containing original files (e.g., mounted evidence image)
- **`-OutputDirectory`** - Where to copy extracted files
- **`-OutputFormat`** - Script type to generate

### **Step 5: Execute Extraction**
```batch
# Run the generated extraction script
.\CHEAPSKATE_Extract_RoboCopy_20250916_143052.bat
```
### Step 6: Cost Savings
- **Before**: Send entire Drive ‚Üí $800K-2M forensic bill
- **After**: Send pre-sorted evidence ‚Üí $5K-20K forensic bill (no need to pay them to scan your ISO's and CAB files)
- **Savings**: 70-90% reduction in vendor costs
- Send only the extracted directory to forensic vendor with professional documentation showing exactly which directories were analyzed and why.
